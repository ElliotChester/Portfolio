This is Elliot Chesters Knights tour code test for Hunted Cow Studios.

The application I created is a C# Console application using .NET Framework.

When running the program, it will ask for a grid size and the position to start the search from.
If the grid size and start position has a possible tour, it will be shown as a grid of move numbers,
aswell as a dynamic grid that updates regularly to show the path that the knight can take for a tour.
